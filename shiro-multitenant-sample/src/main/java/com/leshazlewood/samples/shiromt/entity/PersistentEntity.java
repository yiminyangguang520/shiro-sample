   * This method is declared final and does a lot of performance optimization:
   * <p/>
   * It delegates the actual "equals" check to subclasses via the onEquals method, but it will only do so if the object for equality comparison is
   * <ol>
   * <li>not the same memory location as the current object (fast sanity check)</li>
   * <li>is <code>instanceof</code> Entity</li>
   * <li>Does not have the same id() property</li>
   * </ol>
   * #3 is important:  this is because if two different entities have the ID property already populated, then they have already been inserted in the database, and because
   * of unique constraints on the database (i.e. your 'business key'), you can <em>guarantee</em> that the objects are not the same and there is no need to incur
   * attribute-based comparisons for equals() checks.
   * <p/>
   * This little technique is a massive performance improvement given the number of times equals checks happen in most applications.
   * <p/>
   * <b>IMPLEMENTATION NOTE:</b>.  When writing your {@code onEquals} implementation, <em>never</em>
   * perform equals comparisons of class attributes by referencing them directly, i.e.:
   * <pre>       *bad code*
   * this.someAttribute != null ? this.someAttribute.equals( other.someAttribute ) : other.someAttribute == null;</pre>
   * <p/>
   * This is because direct property access will bypass any Hibernate proxy entirely.  Instead, the accessor methods must be used to allow the proxy to initialize itself
   * if necessary to load the data being checked for equality:
   * <pre>       *good code*
   * getSomeAttribute() != null ? getSomeAttribute().equals(other.getSomeAttribute()) : other.getSomeAttribute() == null;</pre>
